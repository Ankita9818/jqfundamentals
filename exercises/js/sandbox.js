  /* Best among these 3 ways is using eq selector, because With :nth-child(n),
  all children are counted, regardless of what they are, and the specified element is selected only
  if it matches the selector attached to the pseudo-class. With :eq(n) only the selector attached
  to the pseudo-class is counted, not limited to children of any other element, and the
  (n+1)th one (n is 0-based) is selected.:eq() is designed to select a single element while
  :nth-child() or :eq() within a looping construct such as .each() can select multiple elements. */
